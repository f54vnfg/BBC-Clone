# BBC-Page-Clone

This is a clone of the BBC UK News Page from 20 April 2014. It was built using a lot of HTML5 and CSS. The design is totally static, everything was hard-coded into the page.

This project started following few online tutorials, but after being disappointed with how shallow they were, I decided to re-do what I had in a better way and finish the page myself.
