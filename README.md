# BBC-Clone
This is a clone of the BBC UK News Page from 20 April 2014. 
Built using HTML5 and CSS, no JavaScript has been used.

This project started as me following few online tutorials, but after being disappointed with how shallow they were, I decided to re-do what I had done in a better way and finish the page myself.
